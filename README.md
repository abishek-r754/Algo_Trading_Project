# Algo Trading Project – RSI & SMA Strategy

This project is part of my internship assignment where I designed and implemented an **Algorithmic Trading Strategy** using **Python**. The strategy is based on a combination of **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** and **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** indicators.

## 📌 Objective

To analyze stock price trends using technical indicators and automate buy/sell signal generation for selected stocks. This project demonstrates a rule-based trading system with backtesting and Google Sheets integration.

---

## 📈 Strategy Overview

- **Indicators Used**:
  - **RSI** (14-day): To identify overbought and oversold conditions
  - **SMA** (50-day): To track trend direction
- **Buy Signal**: RSI < 30 and price > SMA
- **Sell Signal**: RSI > 70 and price < SMA
